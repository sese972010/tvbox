# wrangler.toml - Configuration for the Cloudflare Worker

# Top-level configuration
name = "tvbox-source-aggregator-api" # The name of your worker
main = "backend/src/index.js"       # The entry point for your worker
compatibility_date = "2023-11-21"   # Use a recent compatibility date

# This file is kept for potential future local development via the command line,
# but our primary and most reliable deployment method is via the Cloudflare Web UI,
# as detailed in README.md.

# The required bindings (like Pages integration) and environment variables (like GH_TOKEN)
# are configured directly in the Cloudflare dashboard according to the README guide.
